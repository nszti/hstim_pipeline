# Welcome to HeureCa !
A modular data processing pipeline designed for analysing 2-photon calcium imaging and electrical stimulation experiments created for Hyperstim.
This site contains detailed documentation for the analysis pipeline


## ðŸ“– What You'll Find Here

- **[Setup](setup/usage.md)**: Step-by-step instructions to set up and run the pipeline.
- **[API Reference](api.md)**: Overview of the available Python modules and functions.

## ðŸ”¬ About the Project

This pipeline supports the analysis of multi-session two-photon imaging experiments, including:

- Extraction and preprocessing of MESc TIFF files
- Suite2p-based ROI detection and signal extraction
- Automated activation analysis and visualization
- ROI tracking across sessions using CellReg

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**, **Suite2p**
- **MATLAB** with **CellReg**
- **Anaconda** for environment management
- **MkDocs** for documentation

---
## Commands for MkDocs development
* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
* `mkdocs gh-deploy` - Deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages.
